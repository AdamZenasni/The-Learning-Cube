# The Learning Cube

This is a learning portal aimed towards primary school students coded in Python. However, SQL is used as well. 

The full code is available within the 'Full Code' folder. The database needed is also available in the 'Database' folder, and so to the pictures in the 'Pictures' folder.

Many different techniques have been used in the code; a Dictonary is used to change the frames, and can be seen in the TLCApp Class. SQL commands can be seen in the UserManagement Class and throughout. A MergeSort algorithm was used, and can be seen in the MergeSortingScores function.
